The source file is CMS national expeditures by state and region. The file includes expeditures for personal health, hospital, physicicans, and clinics and other.


METHODOLOGY - TREND ANALYSIS
1. Calculate Percentage increase in dollar amount spent over time by region.
2. Identify the regions with both the highest increases and the lowest increases
3. For highest and lowest performing region above drill into the data by state.
4. Identify the states with the highest increases and lowest increases
5. Compare practices between highest and lowest performing states to identify differences in practice patterns. Objective is to develop best practice methodology.
Data will need to be reviewed at provider, diagnoses, procedure code level .
6.  Study may provide insights into best practice methodologies that can potentially be adopted nationwide.
7. This comparison can be duplicated for other the other type of services in addition to hospital (personal, physician and clinic, other, and dental).

PROCESS

1. In order to identify highest and lowest performing regions I compared the total cost increase for the most recent 5 year time period.
2. Among all regions:
New England - 18.25%
Rocky Mountain - 35.87%
Mean - 26.4%
3. Amoung states within regions:
New England - Massachusetts - 13.06%
Rocky Mountain - Idaho - 47.66%
Mean - 28.79%

CONCLUSION

Performance varies materially between states. Potential to learn from lower trending states.
