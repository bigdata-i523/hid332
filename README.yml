        Developing nations cope with numerous humanitarian
        challenges. Infrastructures are often inadequate to deal with
        basic public health, public safety, and environmental
        concerns. As a result, citizens deal with issues such as
        poverty, food insecurity, and the unavailability of basic
        health care. Resource limitations often make it difficult to
        manage crisis situations such as natural disasters. The use of
        wireless and Internet related technology is growing globally.
        Mobile phone and social media usage are becoming common even
        in remote areas. As a result, Big Data analytics is playing a
        role in mitigating the impacts of some of these humanitarian
        concerns.
