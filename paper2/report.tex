\begin{abstract}
Developing nations cope with numerous humanitarian challenges. Infrastructures are often inadequate to deal with basic public health, public safety, and environmental concerns. As a result, citizens deal with issues such as poverty, food insecurity, and the availability of basic health care. Impoverished populations are also vulnerable to corrupt government practices. The use of wireless and Internet related technology is growing globally. Mobile phone and social media usage is becoming common even in remote areas. Big Data analytics is playing a role in mitigating the impacts of some of these humanitarian concerns.

\section{Introduction}

In recent years there has been a huge increase in both the availability of digital technology in developing nations. According to the GSM Association seventy nine percent of the worldâ€™s total inhabited areas had mobile network coverage in 2012 \cite{DevEcon}. Social media such as facebook and twitter is being utilized worldwide. In addition, sensor technology is becoming less expensive and more efficient. Better algorthryms are being developed to utilize the low cost sensors for developmental activities. As a result, increasing amounts of data is being generated in developing countries. Data sources include call logs, mobile banking transactions, online user generated content such as blog posts and tweets \cite{GloPls}.

All of this data can be combined with data collected via traditional data sources such as datasets and surveys in such a way to provide information and insights that has never before been available. The diffusion of data science into the realm of international development constitutes an opportunity to bring powerful new tools to the fight against poverty, hunger, and disease \cite{GloPls}. Furthermore, the real time availability of much this data is available enables more timely and agile implementations of solutions. The combination of having more data that is delivered in a more timely real-time fashion are better outcomes.

Put here an introduction about your topic. 
We just need one sample refernce so the paper compiles in LaTeX so we
put it here \cite{editor00}.

\section{figures}

In Figure \ref{f:fly} we show a fly. Please note that because we use
just columwidth that the size of the figure will change to the
columnwidth of the paper once we change the layout to final. CHnaging
the layout to final should not be done by you. All figures will be
listed at the end.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{images/fly.pdf}
  \caption{Example caption}\label{f:fly}
\end{figure}

When copying the example, please do not check in the images from the
examples into your images directory as you will not need them for your
paper. Instead use images that you like to include. If you do not have
any images, do not dreate the images folder.

\section{Tables}

In case you need to create tables, you can do this with online tools
(if you do not mind sharing your data) such as
\url{https://www.tablesgenerator.com/} or other such tools (please
google for them). They even allow you to manage tables as CSV.

or generate them by hand while using the provided template in Table\ref{t:mytable}. Not ethat
the caption is before the tabular environment.

\begin{table}[htb]
\centering
\caption{My caption}
\label{t:mytabble}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
1 & 2 & 3 \\
\hline
4 & 5 & 6 \\
7 & 8 & 9
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section{Long example}

If you like to see a more elaborate example, please look at

\section{Conclusion}

Put here an conclusion. Conlcusions and abstracts must not have any
citations in the section.
